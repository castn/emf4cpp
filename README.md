# What is EMF4CPP? #

EMF4CPP (formerly Ecore2CPP) is a C++ implementation and type mapping for the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) core, the Ecore metamodel.

The current release allows to generate C++ code from Ecore metamodels, and to parse and serialize models and metamodels from and into XMI documents. Also, a reflective API for generated metamodels is provided.

EMF4CPP consists of two parts: a source code generator from Ecore metamodels to C++ and two runtime support libraries. One of the runtime support libraries implements the Ecore metamodel (libemf4cpp-ecore). The other one implements the type mapping, support algorithms, and allows to parse and serialize modeles in XMI format (libemf4cpp-ecorecpp). The generator is currently implemented using Xpand and Xtend.

This is our first step at providing a set of tools for MDD (Model-Driven Development) in C++ as an alternative to the Java world offered by Eclipse tools. We would like to explore common C++ idioms, paradigms and tools (such as template metaprogramming or Boost.Spirit) to provide tools for managing models, writing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), and Model-to-Text (M2T), Model-to-Model (M2M), and Text-to-Model (T2M) transformations.

Two direct advantages can be that C++ programmers can write their data model using Ecore and the Eclipse tools to finally generate code with EMF4CPP, and also, memory consumption and efficiency is usually better in EMF4CPP than in Java, as our preliminary results show.

# Features #

* Generates C++11 libraries from ecore metamodels - per ecore class one C++ class is generated.

* Updates only source files which really change.

* Automatic handling of econtainment and eopposite relations - setting one side of a relation automatically sets the other side.

* Object management via std::shared_ptr<> in the interface and for containment references. Non-containment references are internally kept as std::weak_ptr<> to properly handle relations without an eopposite relation in the model.

* XMI serialization and deserialization of model instances - a resource framework allows splitting of serializations, including cross-resource containment.

* Classifier ids are counted per EPackage, while feature ids are counted per EClass. Feature ids are internally handled in a way, which even allows cross-ecore inheritance.

* Full support for reflection - inspect your metamodel at runtime, including sub-/super-class relations. Powerful enough to implement a generic tree copier.

* A notification framework allows callbacks on model changes - useful in model-view-controller frameworks.

* Creation of Qt5 based item providers - translate class and feature names to user visible strings, and provide pixmaps for a graphical user interface.

* Extension hooks

  * Insert your code into the generated code - protected regions at various places are kept by the code generator.

  * Inject constructor methods into the generated factories - extend a generated class by inheritance and have your classes instantiated from the beginning on, including deserialization.

* Includes support classes from EMF's EcoreUtil package, implemented in the namespace ecorecpp::util, starting with TreeIterator, TreeWalker, CrossReferencer and Copier.

* A dispatcher framework forwards calls to overloaded methods according to the best-match in the class hierarchy.

## EMF4CPP development distribution ##

The EMF4CPP development project consists of four major components:
org.csu.emf4cpp.generator, emf4cpp.tests, the emf4cpp-ecore library, and the
emf4cpp-ecorecpp library. In addition, XMLType is used to support ecore files
which have been created from a XML Schema Definition (xsd).

Two additional components are contained:
emf4cpp.xtext, which is a bootstrap implementation of a ANTLR3 grammars
generator from Xtext grammars, and emf4cpp.xtext2qi, an under development
Boost Sprit Qi grammars generator from Xtext grammars. These components have
an additional requirement:

* Antlr v3 C runtime library (3.2 or greater, [download](http://www.antlr.org/download/C download))

### org.csu.emf4cpp.generator ###

This is a C++ source code generator from metamodels conforming to Ecore.

Implemented as a model workflow it uses xpand to convert the ecore model into
C++ source code. A small java driver accepts command line arguments and passes
it to the workflow. Afterwards a CppBeautifier formats the code.

If you change the xpand2 templates, you need to rebuild the code generator. To
be on the safe side you should always regenerate the emf4cpp-ecore library and
recompile the emf4cpp-ecorecpp library.

### emf4cpp.tests ###

We use some metamodels, distributed over subdirectories, to test our
implementation, and some emf4cpp-based utilities we are developing. A relevant
utility we are developing is a Python interpreter, called PyEcore, that allows
to use EMF4CPP from Python scripts.

### emf4cpp-ecore library ###

This is the C++ implementation of the ecore metamodel itself. It is generated
by emf4cpp from the reference ecore description (in
org.csu.emf4cpp.generator/src/metamodel/Ecore.ecore).

### emf4cpp-ecorecpp library ###

The runtime library emf4cpp-ecorecpp contains the basic infrastructure, which
is required to process instances of ecore metamodels. Aside of the required
mapping from EMF datatypes to C++ datatypes this includes serialization and
de-serialization, a resource framework, a notification framework, and utilities
like a TreeIterator, a CrossReferencer and a Copier.

# Examples #

In this examples we use the _EMF4CPP_PATH_ environment variable with the path in which the EMF4CPP source code generator is installed.

## Example 1: The Company metamodel ##

This example shows the basic usage of EMF4CPP, in which, we generate C++ code from the _company_ metamodel showed in the next figure.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catedrasaes-umu/emf4cpp/images/images/company-metamodel.png)

The process folllowed by this metamodel (and by any metamodel conforming to Ecore) is showed in the next figure.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catedrasaes-umu/emf4cpp/images/images/company-workflow.png)

This process consists in next three main steps. You can follow them downloading the example source from [here](/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catedrasaes-umu/emf4cpp/downloads/emf4cpp-0.0.1-Example1.tgz) and uncompressing it as follows:


```
tar xzf emf4cpp-0.0.1-Example1.tgz
```


### 1. Generate C++ source files from the metamodel (in Ecore XML format). ###


```
cd emf4cpp-0.0.1-Example1
${EMF4CPP_PATH}/bin/emf4cpp.generator.sh company.ecore
```


### 2. Build the metamodel shared library. ###

The produced C++ source code from a metamodel is built as a shared library. To build it, you need use CMake:


```
cmake .
make
```


### 3. Manipulate entities of the types defined in the metamodel in an application linked with the metamodel library and the Ecore2CPP runtime support libraries. ###

In this example, there is an example application that creates a _company_ model, using the library built, above into the _test_ directory. To build it, simply type:


```
cd test
make
```

## Example 2: Creating a metamodel using EMF4CPP at runtime ##

In this example, we create the metamodel above using EMF4CPP.

```cpp
#include <ecore.hpp> // Ecore metamodel
#include <ecorecpp.hpp> // EMF4CPP utils
#include <iostream>

using namespace ecore;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    EcoreFactory_ptr ecoreFactory = EcoreFactory::_instance();
    EcorePackage_ptr ecorePackage = EcorePackage::_instance();

    // Create a Company class
    EClass_ptr companyClass = ecoreFactory->createEClass();
    companyClass->setName("Company");

    // Add name attribute to a Company class
    EAttribute_ptr companyName = ecoreFactory->createEAttribute();
    companyName->setName("name");
    companyName->setEType(ecorePackage->getEString());
    companyClass->getEStructuralFeatures().push_back(companyName);

    // Create an Employee class
    EClass_ptr employeeClass = ecoreFactory->createEClass();
    employeeClass->setName("Employee");

    // Add a name attribute to an Employee class
    EAttribute_ptr employeeName = ecoreFactory->createEAttribute();
    employeeName->setName("name");
    employeeName->setEType(ecorePackage->getEString());
    employeeClass->getEStructuralFeatures().push_back(employeeName);

    // Create a Departament class
    EClass_ptr departmentClass = ecoreFactory->createEClass();
    departmentClass->setName("Department");

    // Add department identification number
    EAttribute_ptr departmentNumber = ecoreFactory->createEAttribute();
    departmentNumber->setName("number");
    departmentNumber->setEType(ecorePackage->getEInt());
    departmentClass->getEStructuralFeatures().push_back(departmentNumber);

    // Department class can contain reference to one or many employees
    EReference_ptr departmentEmployees = ecoreFactory->createEReference();
    departmentEmployees->setName("employees");
    departmentEmployees->setEType(employeeClass);

    // Specify that it could be zero or more employees
    departmentEmployees->setUpperBound(-1);
    departmentEmployees->setContainment(true);
    departmentClass->getEStructuralFeatures().push_back(departmentEmployees);

    // One of the department employees must be the manager
    EReference_ptr departmentManager = ecoreFactory->createEReference();
    departmentManager->setName("manager");
    departmentManager->setEType(employeeClass);
    departmentManager->setLowerBound(1);
    departmentClass->getEStructuralFeatures().push_back(departmentManager);

    // Company can contain reference to zero or more departments
    EReference_ptr companyDepartments = ecoreFactory->createEReference();
    companyDepartments->setName("departments");
    companyDepartments->setEType(departmentClass);
    companyDepartments->setUpperBound(-1);
    companyDepartments->setContainment(true);
    companyClass->getEStructuralFeatures().push_back(companyDepartments);

    // Create a package that represents company
    EPackage_ptr companyPackage = ecoreFactory->createEPackage();
    companyPackage->setName("company");
    companyPackage->setNsPrefix("company");
    companyPackage->setNsURI("http:///com.example.company.ecore");
    companyPackage->getEClassifiers().push_back(employeeClass);
    companyPackage->getEClassifiers().push_back(departmentClass);
    companyPackage->getEClassifiers().push_back(companyClass);

    // Initialize the metamodel
    companyPackage->_initialize();

    // Serializing the metamodel
    std::ofstream stream("company.ecore"); // filename
    ::ecorecpp::serializer::serializer _ser(
        stream, ecorecpp::serializer::serializer::XmiIndentMode::Indentation);
    _ser.serialize(companyPackage);
    stream.close();

    //
    // Deserializing the serialized metamodel
    //

    // Insert the ecore metamodel in the metamodel repository
    // Required for parsing models conforms to that metamodel
    ecorecpp::MetaModelRepository::_instance()->load(ecorePackage);

    // Deserializing the serialized metamodel
    ::ecorecpp::parser::parser _par;
    EPackage_ptr pkg = ::ecore::as< EPackage >(_par.load("company.ecore")); // filename

    // Printing the metamodel
    std::cout << "EPackage: " << pkg->getName() << std::endl;

    const ::ecorecpp::mapping::EList< EClassifier_ptr >& classifiers = pkg->getEClassifiers();
    for (size_t i = 0; i < classifiers.size(); i++)
    {
        std::cout << "  EClassifier: " << classifiers[i]->getName()
                  << " (" << classifiers[i]->eClass()->getName()
                  << ")" << std::endl;
    }

    // All ecore pointers are smart pointers.
}
```

To build this example you must link it with EMF4CPP runtime libraries.

```
g++ -o company -I${EMF4CPP_PATH}/include/emf4cpp -L${EMF4CPP_PATH}/lib -lemf4cpp-ecore -lemf4cpp-ecorecpp example2.cpp
```

Example's output:

```
EPackage: company
  EClassifier: Employee (EClass)
  EClassifier: Department (EClass)
  EClassifier: Company (EClass)
```
